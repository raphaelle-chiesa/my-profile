		<p1> 
		I like to spend my spare time in museums and exhibitions, as well as sketching and improving my skills on Adobe Photoshop and After Effects. I've been coding in Python, Java, HTML and CSS for 2 years, and loving it since the beginning.

		<h2> Art </h2>
			<p2> Artistic culture is a big part of my life. Since my early ages, I recall going to museums and exhibitions with my mom every weekend. Richelieu's gallery in Le Louvre is by far my favorite place to seek inspiration.

		<h3> Editing photos and video clips </h3>
			<p3> I also really like to learn new editing techniques on Adobe's Photoshop and After Effects. This allows me to express my creativity in many ways, and I'm always really excited to work on new challenging projects.

		<h4> Get to know me </h4>
			<p4> I really like to listen to music whenever I can : when I am studying, when I'm sketching and painting, when I'm walking home from school, or even when I am cleaning my apartment. 
			I also really like to travel. I think that my favorite trip was in Rome last summer ; I was very pleased with the archtecture of the Italian Renaissance, and overall the beauty of the city. 
			This year, I had the chance to be recruited in IESEG's artistic student association. There, I can enjoy working in the Communication pole, where I can express my creativity through video editing, photo editing and social medias.
